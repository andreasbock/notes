\section{4D Var}

\textbf{Variational:} means...\\

Kalman filters work well but they have a characteristic defect
in that, unlike 4DVar, they leave behind discontinuous model
trajectories that do not correspond to physically consistent and
continuous model states.

Assimilation is largely on the following form:\\
\[
J(x_a) = (x_a-x_f)\transp B\inv (x_a - x_f) + (H(x_a)- y)\transp R\inv (H(x_a)-y).
