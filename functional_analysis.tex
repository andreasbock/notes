\begin{theorem}[Closed Graph]
Let $X$ and $Y$ be two Banach spaces and $T: D(T)\subset X \rightarrow Y$
be a closed linear operator. If $D(T)$ is closed in $X$, then $T$ is bounded.

$T \text{ injective} \Rightarrow T' \text{ surjective}$:\\



$T \text{ surjective} \Rightarrow T' \text{ injective}$:\\

Suppose $T'f = T'g$ i.e. $(T'f, w) = (T'g, w)$, then $(f, T(w)) = (g, T(w))$.
But since $T$ is surjective then for all $w$ we can find a $v$ such that
$T(w) = v$. As a result, $(f,v)=(g,v)$ so $f=g$.
