\section{Introduction}

Data assimilation deals with the problem of estimating the
(hidden) state of a system by observing partial data.


\emph{Filtering}, or sequential data assimilation refers to the
situation where the state that we estimating, as well
as the partial information we observe about it, has some dynamic
structure.
